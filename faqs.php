                                            <p>Yes. It is recommended that you pack only unbreakable items, such as
                                                linens
                                                and
                                                books.
                                                Remember, all owner-packed items travel at owner’s risk. Our
                                                professional
                                                packing
                                                service is the best way to safeguard against breakage.</p>
